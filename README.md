# SpeakSharp

SpeakSharp is a digital language and communication coach which utilizes personal daily conversations as a learning opportunity. Once consent is provided, this application listens to your speech (intelligently filtering out other individual’s speech and background noise) and provides multidimensional feedback on communication style including improvements in sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammar to name a few. This feedback can be conveniently reviewed by the user in real-time during the conversation or after the fact. 

By utilizing users’ daily conversation, SpeakSharp provides personal and relatable feedback which can be more efficiently integrated and applied by the user compared to applications which use pre-designed or simulated conversations. Additionally, this application can be used globally for any language. For instance, it can translate a dinner table discussion in your native language into your desired target language and  demonstrate how the discussion would unfold in the target language. This uniquely addresses a struggle widely experienced by students globally.
